        <p>&#9829</p><p style="font-weight: bold";>Chip</p> <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
        is the brains of the duo and thus is shown to be clever, fearless,
        and somewhat bossy. Unlike his best friend, he is a quick thinker.
        When dealing with Donald, Chip shows to be much more of a threat
        than Dale, both mentally and physically.</p>

      is more lazy, laid back, and accident-prone. His bumbling is 
      often the cause of misfortune for Chip, which usually leads to Dale
      being punished. Dale is more likely to became endangered,
      forcing Chip to come to his rescue.</p>
